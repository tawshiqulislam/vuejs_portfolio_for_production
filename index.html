If you have a vision you want to bring to life, let's collaborate and make it a reality.. From the moment I discovered the world of technology and design, I knew I had found my calling. After completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering, I dove into web development, honing my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, while gaining proficiency in back-end frameworks like PHP, Laravel, Ruby on Rails, and Java. I have worked on a wide variety of projects, including websites, e-commerce platforms, ERP software, HR management systems, and even IoT and AI-driven applications. With a passion for continuous learning, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and explore emerging technologies to push the boundaries of what's possible.

I believe that technology should be a force for good, and I'm committed to using my skills to make a positive impact on the world.. My curiosity extends beyond web development—I'm also deeply intrigued by data science and the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence. Although my core expertise lies in building web applications and systems, I am excited to expand my skills into data-driven projects that solve real-world problems. I thrive in environments where innovation meets practical application, whether it’s optimizing business processes or creating scalable, cutting-edge systems. When I'm not coding, I love to travel, explore new ideas, and engage in discussions that inspire new perspectives.
